<h3>Who should take this Course?</h3>
<p align="justify">
I designed this course for software engineers willing to develop a Data Engineering pipeline and application using the Apache Spark. I am also creating this course for data architects and data engineers who are responsible for designing and building the organizationâ€™s data-centric infrastructure. Another group of people is the managers and architects who do not directly work with Spark implementation. Still, they work with the people who implement Apache Spark at the ground level.
